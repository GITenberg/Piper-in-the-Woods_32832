description: Earth doctor Henry Harris is tasked with the responsibility of examining
  the men who return from missions across the galaxy. Travelers returning from Asteroid
  Y-3 begin to exhibit strange psychosomatic symptoms -- specifically, they seem to
  believe that they are plants. When this anomaly becomes an epidemic, Dr. Harris
  travels to Asteroid Y-3, hoping to get to the bottom of things. Are the men suffering
  from some kind of mass delusion, or have they stumbled across a hidden truth?
