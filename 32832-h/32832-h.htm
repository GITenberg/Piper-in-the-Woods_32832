<h2><i>By<br />
Philip K. Dick</i></h2></div></div>

<div class="bk3"><p><b><big>Earth maintained an important garrison on
Asteroid Y-3. Now suddenly it was imperiled with
a biological impossibility&mdash;men becoming plants!</big></b></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Well</span>, Corporal Westerburg,"
Doctor Henry Harris
said gently, "just why do you
think you're a plant?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, Harris glanced down
again at the card on his desk. It
was from the Base Commander himself,
made out in Cox's heavy
scrawl: <i>Doc, this is the lad I told
you about. Talk to him and
try to find out how he got this delusion.
He's from the new Garrison,
the new check-station on Asteroid
Y-3, and we don't want
anything to go wrong there. Especially
a silly damn thing like this!</i></p>

<p>Harris pushed the card aside and
stared back up at the youth across
the desk from him. The young
man seemed ill at ease and appeared
to be avoiding answering the question
Harris had put to him. Harris
frowned. Westerburg was a good-looking
chap, actually handsome in
his Patrol uniform, a shock of blond
hair over one eye. He was tall, almost
six feet, a fine healthy lad,
just two years out of Training, according
to the card. Born in Detroit.
Had measles when he was
nine. Interested in jet engines,
tennis, and girls. Twenty-six years
old.</p>

<p>"Well, Corporal Westerburg,"
Doctor Harris said again. "Why do
you think you're a plant?"</p>

<p>The Corporal looked up shyly.
He cleared his throat. "Sir, I <i>am</i>
a plant, I don't just think so. I've
been a plant for several days, now."</p>

<p>"I see." The Doctor nodded. "You
mean that you weren't always a
plant?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I just became a plant
recently."</p>

<p>"And what were you before you
became a plant?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I was just like the
rest of you."</p>

<p>There was silence. Doctor Harris
took up his pen and scratched a
few lines, but nothing of importance
came. A plant? And such a healthy-looking
lad! Harris removed
his steel-rimmed glasses and polished
them with his handkerchief. He
put them on again and leaned back
in his chair. "Care for a cigarette,
Corporal?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>The Doctor lit one himself, resting
his arm on the edge of the
chair. "Corporal, you must realize
that there are very few men who
become plants, especially on such
short notice. I have to admit you
are the first person who has ever
told me such a thing."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I realize it's quite rare."</p>

<p>"You can understand why I'm interested,
then. When you say you're
a plant, you mean you're not capable
of mobility? Or do you mean
you're a vegetable, as opposed to an
animal? Or just what?"</p>

<p>The Corporal looked away. "I
can't tell you any more," he murmured.
"I'm sorry, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, would you mind telling me
<i>how</i> you became a plant?"</p>

<p>Corporal Westerburg hesitated.
He stared down at the floor, then
out the window at the spaceport,
then at a fly on the desk. At last
he stood up, getting slowly to his
feet. "I can't even tell you that,
sir," he said.</p>

<p>"You can't? Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because I promised
not to."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> room was silent. Doctor
Harris rose, too, and they both
stood facing each other. Harris
frowned, rubbing his jaw. "Corporal,
just <i>who</i> did you promise?"</p>

<p>"I can't even tell you that, sir.
I'm sorry."</p>

<p>The Doctor considered this. At
last he went to the door and opened
it. "All right, Corporal. You may
go now. And thanks for your time."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I'm not more helpful."
The Corporal went slowly out and
Harris closed the door after him.
Then he went across his office to
the vidphone. He rang Commander
Cox's letter. A moment later the
beefy good-natured face of the Base
Commander appeared.</p>

<p>"Cox, this is Harris. I talked to
him, all right. All I could get is
the statement that he's a plant.
What else is there? What kind of
behavior pattern?"</p>

<p>"Well," Cox said, "the first thing
they noticed was that he wouldn't
do any work. The Garrison Chief
reported that this Westerburg would
wander off outside the Garrison and
just sit, all day long. Just sit."</p>

<p>"In the sun?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Just sit in the sun. Then
at nightfall he would come back in.
When they asked why he wasn't
working in the jet repair building
he told them he had to be out in
the sun. Then he said&mdash;" Cox hesitated.</p>

<p>"Yes? Said what?"</p>

<p>"He said that work was unnatural.
That it was a waste of time. That
the only worthwhile thing was to sit
and contemplate&mdash;outside."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Then they asked him how he got
that idea, and then he revealed to
them that he had become a plant."</p>

<p>"I'm going to have to talk to
him again, I can see," Harris said.
"And he's applied for a permanent
discharge from the Patrol? What
reason did he give?"</p>

<p>"The same, that he's a plant now,
and has no more interest in being
a Patrolman. All he wants to do is
sit in the sun. It's the damnedest
thing I ever heard."</p>

<p>"All right. I think I'll visit him
in his quarters." Harris looked at
his watch. "I'll go over after dinner."</p>

<p>"Good luck," Cox said gloomily.
"But who ever heard of a man
turning into a plant? We told him
it wasn't possible, but he just smiled
at us."</p>

<p>"I'll let you know how I make
out," Harris said.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Harris</span> walked slowly down the
hall. It was after six; the
evening meal was over. A dim concept
was coming into his mind,
but it was much too soon to be sure.
He increased his pace, turning right
at the end of the hall. Two nurses
passed, hurrying by. Westerburg
was quartered with a buddy, a man
who had been injured in a jet blast
and who was now almost recovered.
Harris came to the dorm wing and
stopped, checking the numbers on
the doors.</p>

<p>"Can I help you, sir?" the robot
attendant said, gliding up.</p>

<p>"I'm looking for Corporal Westerburg's
room."</p>

<p>"Three doors to the right."</p>

<p>Harris went on. Asteroid Y-3 had
only recently been garrisoned and
staffed. It had become the primary
check-point to halt and examine
ships entering the system from outer
space. The Garrison made sure
that no dangerous bacteria, fungus,
or what-not arrived to infect the
system. A nice asteroid it was,
warm, well-watered, with trees and
lakes and lots of sunlight. And the
most modern Garrison in the nine
planets. He shook his head, coming
to the third door. He stopped, raising
his hand and knocking.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" sounded through
the door.</p>

<p>"I want to see Corporal Westerburg."</p>

<p>The door opened. A bovine
youth with horn-rimmed glasses
looked out, a book in his hand.
"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Doctor Harris."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir. Corporal Westerburg
is asleep."</p>

<p>"Would he mind if I woke him
up? I want very much to talk to
him." Harris peered inside. He
could see a neat room, with a desk,
a rug and lamp, and two bunks. On
one of the bunks was Westerburg,
lying face up, his arms folded across
his chest, his eyes tightly closed.</p>

<p>"Sir," the bovine youth said, "I'm
afraid I can't wake him up for
you, much as I'd like to."</p>

<p>"You can't? Why not?"</p>

<p>"Sir, Corporal Westerburg won't
wake up, not after the sun sets. He
just won't. He can't be wakened."</p>

<p>"Cataleptic? Really?"</p>

<p>"But in the morning, as soon as
the sun comes up, he leaps out of
bed and goes outside. Stays the
whole day."</p>

<p>"I see," the Doctor said. "Well,
thanks anyhow." He went back
out into the hall and the door shut
after him. "There's more to this
than I realized," he murmured. He
went on back the way he had come.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> was a warm sunny day. The
sky was almost free of
clouds and a gentle wind moved
through the cedars along the bank
of the stream. There was a path
leading from the hospital building
down the slope to the stream. At
the stream a small bridge led over
to the other side, and a few patients
were standing on the bridge, wrapped
in their bathrobes, looking aimlessly
down at the water.</p>

<p>It took Harris several minutes to
find Westerburg. The youth was
not with the other patients, near or
around the bridge. He had gone
farther down, past the cedar trees
and out onto a strip of bright meadow,
where poppies and grass grew
everywhere. He was sitting on the
stream bank, on a flat grey stone,
leaning back and staring up, his
mouth open a little. He did not
notice the Doctor until Harris was
almost beside him.</p>

<p>"Hello," Harris said softly.</p>

<p>Westerburg opened his eyes, looking
up. He smiled and got slowly
to his feet, a graceful, flowing motion
that was rather surprising for
a man of his size. "Hello, Doctor.
What brings you out here?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Thought I'd get some
sun."</p>

<p>"Here, you can share my rock."
Westerburg moved over and Harris
sat down gingerly, being careful not
to catch his trousers on the sharp
edges of the rock. He lit a cigarette
and gazed silently down at the water.
Beside him, Westerburg had
resumed his strange position, leaning
back, resting on his hands, staring
up with his eyes shut tight.</p>

<p>"Nice day," the Doctor said.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you come here every day?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You like it better out here than
inside."</p>

<p>"I can't stay inside," Westerburg
said.</p>

<p>"You can't? How do you mean,
'can't'?"</p>

<p>"You would die without <i>air</i>,
wouldn't you?" the Corporal said.</p>

<p>"And you'd die without sunlight?"</p>

<p>Westerburg nodded.</p>

<p>"Corporal, may I ask you something?
Do you plan to do this the
rest of your life, sit out in the sun
on a flat rock? Nothing else?"</p>

<p>Westerburg nodded.</p>

<p>"How about your job? You went
to school for years to become a Patrolman.
You wanted to enter the
Patrol very badly. You were given
a fine rating and a first-class position.
How do you feel, giving all
that up? You know, it won't be
easy to get back in again. Do you
realize that?"</p>

<p>"I realize it."</p>

<p>"And you're really going to give
it all up?"</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Harris</span> was silent for a while.
At last he put his cigarette out
and turned toward the youth. "All
right, let's say you give up your
job and sit in the sun. Well, what
happens, then? Someone else has
to do the job instead of you. Isn't
that true? The job has to be done,
<i>your</i> job has to be done. And if
you don't do it someone else has to."</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"Westerburg, suppose everyone
felt the way you do? Suppose everyone
wanted to sit in the sun
all day? What would happen? No
one would check ships coming from
outer space. Bacteria and toxic
crystals would enter the system and
cause mass death and suffering.
Isn't that right?"</p>

<p>"If everyone felt the way I do
they wouldn't be going into outer
space."</p>

<p>"But they have to. They have to
trade, they have to get minerals and
products and new plants."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"To keep society going."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" Harris gestured. "People
couldn't live without society."</p>

<p>Westerburg said nothing to that.
Harris watched him, but the youth
did not answer.</p>

<p>"Isn't that right?" Harris said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. It's a peculiar business,
Doctor. You know, I struggled for
years to get through Training. I
had to work and pay my own way.
Washed dishes, worked in kitchens.
Studied at night, learned, crammed,
worked on and on. And you know
what I think, now?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I wish I'd become a plant earlier."</p>

<p>Doctor Harris stood up. "Westerburg,
when you come inside, will
you stop off at my office? I want
to give you a few tests, if you don't
mind."</p>

<p>"The shock box?" Westerburg
smiled. "I knew that would be
coming around. Sure, I don't mind."</p>

<p>Nettled, Harris left the rock,
walking back up the bank a short
distance. "About three, Corporal?"</p>

<p>The Corporal nodded.</p>

<p>Harris made his way up the hill,
to the path, toward the hospital
building. The whole thing was beginning
to become more clear to
him. A boy who had struggled all his
life. Financial insecurity. Idealized
goal, getting a Patrol assignment.
Finally reached it, found the load
too great. And on Asteroid Y-3 there
was too much vegetation to look at
all day. Primitive identification and
projection on the flora of the asteroid.
Concept of security involved
in immobility and permanence. Unchanging
forest.</p>

<p>He entered the building. A robot
orderly stopped him almost at
once. "Sir, Commander Cox wants
you urgently, on the vidphone."</p>

<p>"Thanks." Harris strode to his
office. He dialed Cox's letter and
the Commander's face came presently
into focus. "Cox? This is
Harris. I've been out talking to the
boy. I'm beginning to get this
lined up, now. I can see the pattern,
too much load too long. Finally
gets what he wants and the
idealization shatters under the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Harris!" Cox barked. "Shut up
and listen. I just got a report from
Y-3. They're sending an express
rocket here. It's on the way."</p>

<p>"An express rocket?"</p>

<p>"Five more cases like Westerburg.
All say they're plants! The Garrison
Chief is worried as hell. Says
we <i>must</i> find out what it is or the
Garrison will fall apart, right away.
Do you get me, Harris? Find out
what it is!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Harris murmured.
"Yes, sir."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">By</span> the end of the week there
were twenty cases, and all, of
course, were from Asteroid Y-3.</p>

<p>Commander Cox and Harris stood
together at the top of the hill, looking
gloomily down at the stream below.
Sixteen men and four women
sat in the sun along the bank, none
of them moving, none speaking. An
hour had gone by since Cox and
Harris appeared, and in all that
time the twenty people below had
not stirred.</p>

<p>"I don't get it," Cox said, shaking
his head. "I just absolutely
don't get it. Harris, is this the beginning
of the end? Is everything
going to start cracking around us?
It gives me a hell of a strange feeling
to see those people down there,
basking away in the sun, just sitting
and basking."</p>

<p>"Who's that man there with the
red hair?"</p>

<p>"That's Ulrich Deutsch. He was
Second in Command at the Garrison.
Now look at him! Sits and
dozes with his mouth open and his
eyes shut. A week ago that man
was climbing, going right up to the
top. When the Garrison Chief retires
he was supposed to take over.
Maybe another year, at the most.
All his life he's been climbing to get
up there."</p>

<p>"And now he sits in the sun,"
Harris finished.</p>

<p>"That woman. The brunette,
with the short hair. Career woman.
Head of the entire office staff of
the Garrison. And the man beside
her. Janitor. And that cute little
gal there, with the bosom. Secretary,
just out of school. All kinds.
And I got a note this morning,
three more coming in sometime today."</p>

<p>Harris nodded. "The strange thing
is&mdash;they really <i>want</i> to sit down
there. They're completely rational;
they could do something else, but
they just don't care to."</p>

<p>"Well?" Cox said. "What are
you going to do? Have you found
anything? We're counting on you.
Let's hear it."</p>

<p>"I couldn't get anything out of
them directly," Harris said, "but
I've had some interesting results
with the shock box. Let's go inside
and I'll show you."</p>

<p>"Fine," Cox turned and started
toward the hospital. "Show me anything
you've got. This is serious.
Now I know how Tiberius felt
when Christianity showed up in high
places."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Harris</span> snapped off the light.
The room was pitch black.
"I'll run this first reel for you. The
subject is one of the best biologists
stationed at the Garrison. Robert
Bradshaw. He came in yesterday.
I got a good run from the shock
box because Bradshaw's mind is so
highly differentiated. There's a lot
of repressed material of a non-rational
nature, more than usual."</p>

<p>He pressed a switch. The projector
whirred, and on the far wall
a three-dimensional image appeared
in color, so real that it might
have been the man himself. Robert
Bradshaw was a man of fifty, heavy-set,
with iron grey hair and a
square jaw. He sat in the chair
calmly, his hands resting on the
arms, oblivious to the electrodes attached
to his neck and wrist. "There
I go," Harris said. "Watch."</p>

<p>His film-image appeared, approaching
Bradshaw. "Now, Mr.
Bradshaw," his image said, "this
won't hurt you at all, and it'll help
us a lot." The image rotated the
controls on the shock box. Bradshaw
stiffened, and his jaw set, but otherwise
he gave no sign. The image of
Harris regarded him for a time and
then stepped away from the controls.</p>

<p>"Can you hear me, Mr. Bradshaw?"
the image asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Robert C. Bradshaw."</p>

<p>"What is your position?"</p>

<p>"Chief Biologist at the check-station
on Y-3."</p>

<p>"Are you there now?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm back on Terra. In a
hospital."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I admitted to the Garrison
Chief that I had become a
plant."</p>

<p>"Is that true? That you are a
plant."</p>

<p>"Yes, in a non-biological sense.
I retain the physiology of a human
being, of course."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, then, that
you're a plant?"</p>

<p>"The reference is to attitudinal response,
to Weltanschauung."</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"It is possible for a warm-blooded
animal, an upper primate, to
adopt the psychology of a plant, to
some extent."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"I refer to this."</p>

<p>"And the others? They refer to
this also?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How did this occur, your adopting
this attitude?"</p>

<p>Bradshaw's image hesitated, the
lips twisting. "See?" Harris said
to Cox. "Strong conflict. He
wouldn't have gone on, if he had
been fully conscious."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"I was taught to become a plant."</p>

<p>The image of Harris showed surprise
and interest. "What do you
mean, you were <i>taught</i> to become a
plant?"</p>

<p>"They realized my problems and
taught me to become a plant. Now
I'm free from them, the problems."</p>

<p>"Who? Who taught you?"</p>

<p>"The Pipers."</p>

<p>"Who? The Pipers? Who are
the Pipers?"</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bradshaw, who are the Pipers?"</p>

<p>After a long, agonized pause, the
heavy lips parted. "They live in
the woods...."</p>

<p>Harris snapped off the projector,
and the lights came on. He and
Cox blinked. "That was all I could
get," Harris said. "But I was lucky
to get that. He wasn't supposed to
tell, not at all. That was the thing
they all promised not to do, tell
who taught them to become plants.
The Pipers who live in the woods,
on Asteroid Y-3."</p>

<p>"You got this story from all
twenty?"</p>

<p>"No." Harris grimaced. "Most
of them put up too much fight. I
couldn't even get <i>this</i> much from
them."</p>

<p>Cox reflected. "The Pipers. Well?
What do you propose to do? Just
wait around until you can get the
full story? Is that your program?"</p>

<p>"No," Harris said. "Not at all.
I'm going to Y-3 and find out who
the Pipers are, myself."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> small patrol ship made its
landing with care and precision,
its jets choking into final silence.
The hatch slid back and Doctor
Henry Harris found himself staring
out at a field, a brown, sun-baked
landing field. At the end of the
field was a tall signal tower. Around
the field on all sides were long grey
buildings, the Garrison check-station
itself. Not far off a huge Venusian
cruiser was parked, a vast
green hulk, like an enormous lime.
The technicians from the station
were swarming all over it, checking
and examining each inch of it for
lethal life-forms and poisons that
might have attached themselves to
the hull.</p>

<p>"All out, sir," the pilot said.</p>

<p>Harris nodded. He took hold
of his two suitcases and stepped
carefully down. The ground was
hot underfoot, and he blinked in
the bright sunlight. Jupiter was in
the sky, and the vast planet reflected
considerable sunlight down onto
the asteroid.</p>

<p>Harris started across the field,
carrying his suitcases. A field attendant
was already busy opening
the storage compartment of the patrol
ship, extracting his trunk. The
attendant lowered the trunk into a
waiting dolly and came after him,
manipulating the little truck with
bored skill.</p>

<p>As Harris came to the entrance
of the signal tower the gate slid
back and a man came forward, an
older man, large and robust, with
white hair and a steady walk.</p>

<p>"How are you, Doctor?" he said,
holding his hand out. "I'm Lawrence
Watts, the Garrison Chief."</p>

<p>They shook hands. Watts smiled
down at Harris. He was a huge
old man, still regal and straight in
his dark blue uniform, with his
gold epaulets sparkling on his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Have a good trip?" Watts asked.
"Come on inside and I'll have a
drink fixed for you. It gets hot
around here, with the Big Mirror up
there."</p>

<p>"Jupiter?" Harris followed him
inside the building. The signal
tower was cool and dark, a welcome
relief. "Why is the gravity so near
Terra's? I expected to go flying
off like a kangaroo. Is it artificial?"</p>

<p>"No. There's a dense core of
some kind to the asteroid, some kind
of metallic deposit. That's why we
picked this asteroid out of all the
others. It made the construction
problem much simpler, and it also
explains why the asteroid has natural
air and water. Did you see
the hills?"</p>

<p>"The hills?"</p>

<p>"When we get up higher in the
tower we'll be able to see over the
buildings. There's quite a natural
park here, a regular little forest,
complete with everything you'd
want. Come in here, Harris. This
is my office." The old man strode
at quite a clip, around the corner
and into a large, well-furnished
apartment. "Isn't this pleasant? I
intend to make my last year here
as amiable as possible." He frowned.
"Of course, with Deutsch gone, I
may be here forever. Oh, well." He
shrugged. "Sit down, Harris."</p>

<p>"Thanks." Harris took a chair,
stretching his legs out. He watched
Watts as he closed the door to the
hall. "By the way, any more cases
come up?"</p>

<p>"Two more today," Watts was
grim. "Makes almost thirty, in all.
We have three hundred men in this
station. At the rate it's going&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Chief, you spoke about a forest
on the asteroid. Do you allow the
crew to go into the forest at will?
Or do you restrict them to the
buildings and grounds?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Watts</span> rubbed his jaw. "Well,
it's a difficult situation,
Harris. I have to let the men leave
the grounds sometimes. They can
<i>see</i> the forest from the buildings,
and as long as you can see a nice
place to stretch out and relax that
does it. Once every ten days they
have a full period of rest. Then
they go out and fool around."</p>

<p>"And then it happens?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so. But as long
as they can see the forest they'll
want to go. I can't help it."</p>

<p>"I know. I'm not censuring you.
Well, what's your theory? What
happens to them out there? What
do they do?"</p>

<p>"What happens? Once they get
out there and take it easy for
a while they don't want to come back
and work. It's boondoggling. Playing
hookey. They don't want to
work, so off they go."</p>

<p>"How about this business of their
delusions?"</p>

<p>Watts laughed good-naturedly.
"Listen, Harris. You know as well
as I do that's a lot of poppycock.
They're no more plants than you or
I. They just don't want to work,
that's all. When I was a cadet we
had a few ways to make people
work. I wish we could lay a few on
their backs, like we used to."</p>

<p>"You think this is simple goldbricking,
then?"</p>

<p>"Don't you think it is?"</p>

<p>"No," Harris said. "They really
believe they're plants. I put them
through the high-frequency shock
treatment, the shock box. The whole
nervous system is paralyzed, all inhibitions
stopped cold. They tell
the truth, then. And they said the
same thing&mdash;and more."</p>

<p>Watts paced back and forth, his
hands clasped behind his back.
"Harris, you're a doctor, and I
suppose you know what you're talking
about. But look at the situation
here. We have a garrison, a
good modern garrison. We're probably
the most modern outfit in the
system. Every new device and gadget
is here that science can produce.
Harris, this garrison is one vast machine.
The men are parts, and
each has his job, the Maintenance
Crew, the Biologists, the Office
Crew, the Managerial Staff.</p>

<p>"Look what happens when one
person steps away from his job.
Everything else begins to creak. We
can't service the bugs if no one services
the machines. We can't order
food to feed the crews if no one
makes out reports, takes inventories.
We can't direct any kind of activity
if the Second in Command decides
to go out and sit in the sun all day.</p>

<p>"Thirty people, one tenth of the
Garrison. But we can't run without
them. The Garrison is built
that way. If you take the supports
out the whole building falls. No
one can leave. We're all tied here,
and these people know it. They
know they have no right to do that,
run off on their own. No one has
that right anymore. We're all too
tightly interwoven to suddenly
start doing what we want. It's unfair
to the rest, the majority."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Harris</span> nodded. "Chief, can I
ask you something?"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Are there any inhabitants on the
asteroid? Any natives?"</p>

<p>"Natives?" Watts considered.
"Yes, there's some kind of aborigines
living out there." He waved
vaguely toward the window.</p>

<p>"What are they like? Have you
seen them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've seen them. At least, I
saw them when we first came here.
They hung around for a while,
watching us, then after a time they
disappeared."</p>

<p>"Did they die off? Diseases of
some kind?"</p>

<p>"No. They just&mdash;just disappeared.
Into their forest. They're
still there, someplace."</p>

<p>"What kind of people are they?"</p>

<p>"Well, the story is that they're
originally from Mars. They don't
look much like Martians, though.
They're dark, a kind of coppery
color. Thin. Very agile, in their
own way. They hunt and fish. No
written language. We don't pay
much attention to them."</p>

<p>"I see." Harris paused. "Chief,
have you ever heard of anything
called&mdash;The Pipers?"</p>

<p>"The Pipers?" Watts frowned.
"No. Why?"</p>

<p>"The patients mentioned something
called The Pipers. According
to Bradshaw, the Pipers taught him
to become a plant. He learned it
from them, a kind of teaching."</p>

<p>"The Pipers. What are they?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Harris admitted.
"I thought maybe you might know.
My first assumption, of course, was
that they're the natives. But now
I'm not so sure, not after hearing
your description of them."</p>

<p>"The natives are primitive savages.
They don't have anything to
teach anybody, especially a top-flight
biologist."</p>

<p>Harris hesitated. "Chief, I'd like
to go into the woods and look
around. Is that possible?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I can arrange it for
you. I'll give you one of the men
to show you around."</p>

<p>"I'd rather go alone. Is there
any danger?"</p>

<p>"No, none that I know of. Except&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Except the Pipers," Harris finished.
"I know. Well, there's only
one way to find them, and that's it.
I'll have to take my chances."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"If</span> you walk in a straight line,"
Chief Watts said, "you'll find
yourself back at the Garrison in
about six hours. It's a damn small
asteroid. There's a couple of
streams and lakes, so don't fall in."</p>

<p>"How about snakes or poisonous
insects?"</p>

<p>"Nothing like that reported. We
did a lot of tramping around at
first, but it's grown back now, the
way it was. We never encountered
anything dangerous."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Chief," Harris said.
They shook hands. "I'll see you before
nightfall."</p>

<p>"Good luck." The Chief and his
two armed escorts turned and went
back across the rise, down the other
side toward the Garrison. Harris
watched them go until they disappeared
inside the building. Then
he turned and started into the grove
of trees.</p>

<p>The woods were very silent around
him as he walked. Trees towered
up on all sides of him, huge dark-green
trees like eucalyptus. The
ground underfoot was soft with endless
leaves that had fallen and rotted
into soil. After a while the grove
of high trees fell behind and he
found himself crossing a dry meadow,
the grass and weeds burned
brown in the sun. Insects buzzed
around him, rising up from the
dry weed-stalks. Something scuttled
ahead, hurrying through the undergrowth.
He caught sight of a
grey ball with many legs, scampering
furiously, its antennae weaving.</p>

<p>The meadow ended at the bottom
of a hill. He was going up, now,
going higher and higher. Ahead of
him an endless expanse of green
rose, acres of wild growth. He
scrambled to the top finally, blowing
and panting, catching his breath.</p>

<p>He went on. Now he was going
down again, plunging into a deep
gully. Tall ferns grew, as large as
trees. He was entering a living
Jurassic forest, ferns that stretched
out endlessly ahead of him. Down
he went, walking carefully. The air
began to turn cold around him.
The floor of the gully was damp
and silent; underfoot the ground
was almost wet.</p>

<p>He came out on a level table. It
was dark, with the ferns growing
up on all sides, dense growths of
ferns, silent and unmoving. He
came upon a natural path, an old
stream bed, rough and rocky, but
easy to follow. The air was thick
and oppressive. Beyond the ferns
he could see the side of the next
hill, a green field rising up.</p>

<p>Something grey was ahead. Rocks,
piled-up boulders, scattered and
stacked here and there. The stream
bed led directly to them. Apparently
this had been a pool of some
kind, a stream emptying from it. He
climbed the first of the boulders
awkwardly, feeling his way up. At
the top he paused, resting again.</p>

<p>As yet he had had no luck. So
far he had not met any of the natives.
It would be through them
that he would find the mysterious
Pipers that were stealing the men
away, if such really existed. If he
could find the natives, talk to them,
perhaps he could find out something.
But as yet he had been unsuccessful.
He looked around. The woods
were very silent. A slight breeze
moved through the ferns, rustling
them, but that was all. Where were
the natives? Probably they had a
settlement of some sort, huts, a
clearing. The asteroid was small;
he should be able to find them by
nightfall.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> started down the rocks.
More rocks rose up ahead and
he climbed them. Suddenly he
stopped, listening. Far off, he could
hear a sound, the sound of water.
Was he approaching a pool of some
kind? He went on again, trying
to locate the sound. He scrambled
down rocks and up rocks, and all
around him there was silence, except
for the splashing of distant water.
Maybe a waterfall, water in
motion. A stream. If he found
the stream he might find the natives.</p>

<p>The rocks ended and the stream
bed began again, but this time it
was wet, the bottom muddy and
overgrown with moss. He was on
the right track; not too long ago
this stream had flowed, probably
during the rainy season. He went
up on the side of the stream, pushing
through the ferns and vines. A
golden snake slid expertly out of
his path. Something glinted ahead,
something sparkling through the
ferns. Water. A pool. He hurried,
pushing the vines aside and
stepping out, leaving them behind.</p>

<p>He was standing on the edge of
a pool, a deep pool sunk in a hollow
of grey rocks, surrounded by
ferns and vines. The water was
clear and bright, and in motion,
flowing in a waterfall at the far
end. It was beautiful, and he
stood watching, marveling at it, the
undisturbed quality of it. Untouched,
it was. Just as it had
always been, probably. As long as
the asteroid existed. Was he the
first to see it? Perhaps. It was so
hidden, so concealed by the ferns.
It gave him a strange feeling, a feeling
almost of ownership. He stepped
down a little toward the water.</p>

<p>And it was then he noticed her.</p>

<p>The girl was sitting on the far
edge of the pool, staring down into
the water, resting her head on
one drawn-up knee. She had
been bathing; he could see that at
once. Her coppery body was still
wet and glistening with moisture,
sparkling in the sun. She had not
seen him. He stopped, holding his
breath, watching her.</p>

<p>She was lovely, very lovely, with
long dark hair that wound around
her shoulders and arms. Her body
was slim, very slender, with a supple
grace to it that made him stare,
accustomed as he was to various
forms of anatomy. How silent she
was! Silent and unmoving, staring
down at the water. Time passed,
strange, unchanging time, as he
watched the girl. Time might even
have ceased, with the girl sitting on
the rock staring into the water, and
the rows of great ferns behind her,
as rigid as if they had been painted
there.</p>

<p>All at once the girl looked up.
Harris shifted, suddenly conscious
of himself as an intruder. He stepped
back. "I'm sorry," he murmured.
"I'm from the Garrison. I
didn't mean to come poking around."</p>

<p>She nodded without speaking.</p>

<p>"You don't mind?" Harris asked
presently.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>So she spoke Terran! He moved
a little toward her, around the side
of the pool. "I hope you don't
mind my bothering you. I won't
be on the asteroid very long. This
is my first day here. I just arrived
from Terra."</p>

<p>She smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"I'm a doctor. Henry Harris."
He looked down at her, at the slim
coppery body, gleaming in the sunlight,
a faint sheen of moisture on
her arms and thighs. "You might
be interested in why I'm here." He
paused. "Maybe you can even
help me."</p>

<p>She looked up a little. "Oh?"</p>

<p>"Would you like to help me?"</p>

<p>She smiled. "Yes. Of course."</p>

<p>"That's good. Mind if I sit
down?" He looked around and
found himself a flat rock. He sat
down slowly, facing her. "Cigarette?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll have one." He lit up,
taking a deep breath. "You see, we
have a problem at the Garrison.
Something has been happening to
some of the men, and it seems to
be spreading. We have to find out
what causes it or we won't be able
to run the Garrison."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> waited for a moment. She
nodded slightly. How silent
she was! Silent and unmoving.
Like the ferns.</p>

<p>"Well, I've been able to find out
a few things from them, and one
very interesting fact stands out.
They keep saying that something
called&mdash;called The Pipers are responsible
for their condition. They
say the Pipers taught them&mdash;" He
stopped. A strange look had flitted
across her dark, small face. "Do
you know the Pipers?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>Acute satisfaction flooded over
Harris. "You do? I was sure the
natives would know." He stood up
again. "I was sure they would, if
the Pipers really existed. Then they
do exist, do they?"</p>

<p>"They exist."</p>

<p>Harris frowned. "And they're
here, in the woods?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I see." He ground his cigarette
out impatiently. "You don't
suppose there's any chance you
could take me to them, do you?"</p>

<p>"Take you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I have this problem and
I have to solve it. You see, the
Base Commander on Terra has assigned
this to me, this business about
the Pipers. It has to be solved.
And I'm the one assigned to the
job. So it's important to me to find
them. Do you see? Do you understand?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, will you take me to them?"</p>

<p>The girl was silent. For a long
time she sat, staring down into the
water, resting her head against her
knee. Harris began to become impatient.
He fidgeted back and
forth, resting first on one leg and
then on the other.</p>

<p>"Well, will you?" he said again.
"It's important to the whole Garrison.
What do you say?" He felt
around in his pockets. "Maybe I
could give you something. What
do I have...." He brought out
his lighter. "I could give you my
lighter."</p>

<p>The girl stood up, rising slowly,
gracefully, without motion or effort.
Harris' mouth fell open. How supple
she was, gliding to her feet in a
single motion! He blinked. Without
effort she had stood, seemingly
without <i>change</i>. All at once she
was standing instead of sitting,
standing and looking calmly at him,
her small face expressionless.</p>

<p>"Will you?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes. Come along." She turned
away, moving toward the row of
ferns.</p>

<p>Harris followed quickly, stumbling
across the rocks. "Fine," he
said. "Thanks a lot. I'm very interested
to meet these Pipers.
Where are you taking me, to your
village? How much time do we
have before nightfall?"</p>

<p>The girl did not answer. She had
entered the ferns already, and Harris
quickened his pace to keep from
losing her. How silently she glided!</p>

<p>"Wait," he called. "Wait for
me."</p>

<p>The girl paused, waiting for him,
slim and lovely, looking silently
back.</p>

<p>He entered the ferns, hurrying after
her.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Well</span>, I'll be damned!"
Commander Cox said. "It
sure didn't take you long." He
leaped down the steps two at a time.
"Let me give you a hand."</p>

<p>Harris grinned, lugging his heavy
suitcases. He set them down and
breathed a sigh of relief. "It isn't
worth it," he said. "I'm going to
give up taking so much."</p>

<p>"Come on inside. Soldier, give
him a hand." A Patrolman hurried
over and took one of the suitcases.
The three men went inside and
down the corridor to Harris' quarters.
Harris unlocked the door and
the Patrolman deposited his suitcase
inside.</p>

<p>"Thanks," Harris said. He set
the other down beside it. "It's
good to be back, even for a little
while."</p>

<p>"A little while?"</p>

<p>"I just came back to settle my affairs.
I have to return to Y-3 tomorrow
morning."</p>

<p>"Then you didn't solve the problem?"</p>

<p>"I solved it, but I haven't <i>cured</i>
it. I'm going back and get to work
right away. There's a lot to be
done."</p>

<p>"But you found out what it is?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It was just what the men
said. The Pipers."</p>

<p>"The Pipers do exist?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Harris nodded. "They do
exist." He removed his coat and
put it over the back of the chair.
Then he went to the window and let
it down. Warm spring air rushed
into the room. He settled himself
on the bed, leaning back.</p>

<p>"The Pipers exist, all right&mdash;in
the minds of the Garrison crew! To
the crew, the Pipers are real. The
crew created them. It's a mass
hypnosis, a group projection, and
all the men there have it, to some
degree."</p>

<p>"How did it start?"</p>

<p>"Those men on Y-3 were sent
there because they were skilled,
highly-trained men with exceptional
ability. All their lives they've been
schooled by complex modern society,
fast tempo and high integration between
people. Constant pressure
toward some goal, some job to be
done.</p>

<p>"Those men are put down suddenly
on an asteroid where there
are natives living the most primitive
of existence, completely vegetable
lives. No concept of goal, no concept
of purpose, and hence no ability
to plan. The natives live the way
the animals live, from day to day,
sleeping, picking food from the trees.
A kind of Garden-of-Eden existence,
without struggle or conflict."</p>

<p>"So? But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Each of the Garrison crew sees
the natives and <i>unconsciously</i> thinks
of his own early life, when he was
a child, when <i>he</i> had no worries,
no responsibilities, before he joined
modern society. A baby lying in
the sun.</p>

<p>"But he can't admit this to himself!
He can't admit that he might
<i>want</i> to live like the natives, to lie
and sleep all day. So he invents
The Pipers, the idea of a mysterious
group living in the woods who trap
him, lead him into their kind of
life. Then he can blame <i>them</i>, not
himself. They 'teach' him to become
a part of the woods."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do? Have
the woods burned?"</p>

<p>"No." Harris shook his head.
"That's not the answer; the woods
are harmless. The answer is psychotherapy
for the men. That's
why I'm going right back, so I can
begin work. They've got to be
made to see that the Pipers are inside
them, their own unconscious
voices calling to them to give up
their responsibilities. They've got
to be made to realize that there
are no Pipers, at least, not outside
themselves. The woods are harmless
and the natives have nothing to
teach anyone. They're primitive
savages, without even a written
language. We're seeing a psychological
projection by a whole Garrison
of men who want to lay down
their work and take it easy for
a while."</p>

<p>The room was silent.</p>

<p>"I see," Cox said presently.
"Well, it makes sense." He got to
his feet. "I hope you can do something
with the men when you get
back."</p>

<p>"I hope so, too," Harris agreed.
"And I think I can. After all, it's
just a question of increasing their
self-awareness. When they have
that the Pipers will vanish."</p>

<p>Cox nodded. "Well, you go
ahead with your unpacking, Doc.
I'll see you at dinner. And maybe
before you leave, tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Fine."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Harris</span> opened the door and
the Commander went out into
the hall. Harris closed the door
after him and then went back across
the room. He looked out the window
for a moment, his hands in his
pockets.</p>

<p>It was becoming evening, the air
was turning cool. The sun was just
setting as he watched, disappearing
behind the buildings of the city
surrounding the hospital. He watched
it go down.</p>

<p>Then he went over to his two
suitcases. He was tired, very tired
from his trip. A great weariness
was beginning to descend over him.
There were so many things to do,
so terribly many. How could he
hope to do them all? Back to the
asteroid. And then what?</p>

<p>He yawned, his eyes closing. How
sleepy he was! He looked over at
the bed. Then he sat down on the
edge of it and took his shoes off.
So much to do, the next day.</p>

<p>He put his shoes in the corner
of the room. Then he bent over,
unsnapping one of the suitcases.
He opened the suitcase. From it he
took a bulging gunnysack. Carefully,
he emptied the contents of the
sack out on the floor. Dirt, rich
soft dirt. Dirt he had collected during
his last hours there, dirt he had
carefully gathered up.</p>

<p>When the dirt was spread out
on the floor he sat down in the middle
of it. He stretched himself
out, leaning back. When he was
fully comfortable he folded his
hands across his chest and closed
his eyes. So much work to do&mdash;But
later on, of course. Tomorrow.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
